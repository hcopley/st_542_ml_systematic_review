## Data Import Notes: 

1/29/26: Imported training data and file with records that were selected for full text screening 
flagged records that were selected for screening. 

Imported a single file from the "new data" in .ris format as a test in both R and python
python uses rispy library, R uses revtools

Next steps: combine new data into single df, assess missingness, viability of columns, size shape, etc for both training and new data.
